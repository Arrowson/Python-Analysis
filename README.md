# Python Cover-Letter-Analysis
---
### Overview
This is a Python program that takes in a cover letter, (or any block of text)
and outputs the sentiment analysis of the text. 
---
### How it works
Using IBM Watson's tonal recognition API, the program simply makes a call to it
and prints out the resulting sentiment scores. 
---
### General Demonstration
Example: When given the To Be or Not To Be soliloquy from Hamlet, the program 
responds with the following scores:

The higher the score for each aspect, the more of that tone is registered


Anger
          score:  10.1591 %
Disgust
          score:  16.9605 %
Fear
          score:  49.7345 %
Joy
          score:  48.0946 %
Sadness
          score:  64.34020000000001 %

### Uses
While the program is currently a pet project, there are plans to implement
various other technologies along with the current running software to 
help those on the Autism spectrum to analyze their tones when applying for
jobs that require a cover letter or other form of writing.
